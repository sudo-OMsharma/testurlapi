# Multi Brain PersonaAI is a custom llm platform where multiple custom knowledge llm bots can be prepared with userâ€™s access to ingest or delete data. And the user can ask questions in natural language and get answers in the same from the ingested documents.

## API Reference

#### createbrains API 

#### Description 

This API allows users to create a new brain (Folder in S3) by providing a unique brain name and a personality name. The brain is created in the S3 bucket and the file index range is saved.

```http
  POST /createbrains/start
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `brainName` | `string` | **Required** The unique identifier for the new brain
 `personality_name`| `string` | **Required** The personality name associated with the brain. Should only contain alphabetic characters and spaces.

#### upload API 

#### Description 

This API allows users to upload files to a specific brain. The files are processed, their content is converted to text, and embeddings are created or appended for the brain.


```http
  POST /upload/start
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `brainName` | `string` | **Required** The unique identifier for the brain
 `file`| `file` | **Required** The files to be uploaded. Supports .txt, .pdf, and .docx formats. Multiple files can be uploaded at once.


#### chat API 

#### Description 

This API allows users to interact with the custom LLM bots by asking questions in natural language and getting responses based on the ingested documents.

```http
  POST /chat/start
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `llm` | `string` | **Required** The language model to be used. Should be 'openai'.
 `brainName`| `string` | **Required** The identifier for the specific folder (brain)
 `current_user_quetsion` | `string` | **Required** The question being asked by the user 
 `word_limit`| `int` | **Required** The maximum number of words in the response|
 `previous_question`| `string` | The previous question asked in the session.
 `previous_answer`| `string` | The previous answer provided in the session.


#### deletefile API 

#### Description 

This API allows users to delete specific files from a given brain. The embeddings and indexes associated with these files are also removed.


```http
  POST /deletefile/start
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `brainName` | `string` | **Required** The unique identifier for the brain
 `file_names`| `file` | **Required** file that needs to be deleted from the specified brain. Multiple file can be deleted at once.

#### deletebrain API 

#### Description 

This API deletes a specified brain from both the runtime memory and the S3 storage system.


```http
  POST /deletebrain/start
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `brainName` | `string` | **Required** The unique identifier for the brain

#### deleteram API 

#### Description 

This API deletes a specified brain's embedding data from runtime memory. If no brain name is provided, it clears all brain indexes from memory.


```http
  POST /deletebrain/start
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `brainName` | `string` | The unique identifier for the brain

#### membrains API 

#### Description 

This API retrieves the current state of the MASTER_EMBEDDING_ARRAY from memory, displaying the runtime embeddings of all brains. (Shows number of brains loaded in the memory)


```http
  GET /membrains/start
```

 This api does not require any Parameters.
